# Sprint 2.0: Workflow System Refactoring

**Objective**: Consolidate and standardize the workflow system for `.agent` directory.
**Status**: PLANNING

## Backlog
- [ ] Create `.agent/workflows/README.md` explaining the workflow system
- [ ] Verify all workflows (`/sprint`, `/agent`) are properly documented
- [ ] Remove any duplicate or obsolete workflow files
- [ ] Update `SPRINT_GUIDE.md` to reference workflows correctly

## Context
The `.agent/workflows/` directory contains "slash command" style guides:
- `/sprint` - How to create sprint plans
- `/agent` - How to act as external agentic intelligence

This sprint ensures these are properly integrated and documented.
