## The Story Behind the Code

Hi, I'm **Tri Wantoro**.

This repository—**[Nama Project]**—is a small reflection of a long learning process; one that spans different roles, environments, and layers of technology.

### A Journey Through the Stack
My understanding of software didn’t start with frameworks or libraries, but grew through different perspectives:

* **Listening to Users (Customer Service)**
  Supporting users taught me how frustrating technology can be when it doesn’t behave as expected.
  → *It made me more careful about UX decisions, error handling, and communication through the interface.*

* **Learning Structure from Hardware (Electronics Technician)**
  Working with electronic components reinforced basic principles: clear inputs, predictable processes, and measurable outputs.
  → *In software, I try to apply the same discipline through modular and testable code.*

* **Respecting Production Environments (System Integrator — Ongoing)**
  Working with Linux servers and integrated systems (Milestone VMS) taught me that small mistakes can have real consequences.
  → *Because of this, I tend to be cautious about security, logging, and resource usage.*

* **Connecting Theory with Practice (Formal Education)**
  Completing an Information Systems degree (GPA 3.93) while working full-time reminded me that **textbooks and real-world constraints often need to meet halfway.**

* **Continuing to Build (Software Engineering Focus)**
  In this project, I chose **[Teknologi Utama]** for [Alasan Teknis Singkat] and **[Teknologi Pendukung]** for [Alasan Teknis Singkat].
  → *These tools let me focus on the product, not the plumbing—allowing me to write code that is easier to understand, maintain, and operate.*

### A Note About This Repository
**Nothing here is meant to be “perfect.”**

This code represents what I currently understand, shaped by past experiences and ongoing work in real environments. If you find something that can be improved, it probably can—and I welcome that feedback.

## Project Overview

**[Project Name]** is a [Web Application/Tool] designed to [Briefly describe the core problem it solves].

I built this project to bridge the gap I often see in the field: software that works technically but fails practically. Leveraging my background in **Product Thinking** and **System Integration**, this application focuses on reliability and user ease-of-use.

### Key Features

## Tech Stack & Engineering Decisions

| Component | Tech Selection | Engineering Context (The "Why") |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| **Backend** | **Laravel 12** | Chosen for its robust ecosystem and strict structure, mirroring the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) I use in system integration. |
| **Frontend** | **React 19** | Component-based foundation allowing for modular "Field Replaceable Units" of UI. |
| **Logic** | **Inertia.js** | Reducing complexity by maintaining a unified monolith structure (The "Integrated Circuit" approach). |
| **Database** | **SQLite/MySQL** | Relational data integrity is non-negotiable for scalable systems. |

### Technical Highlight: From Hardware to Software
**Challenge:** [Describe a specific technical challenge faced].

**Solution (The RCA Approach):**
Applying my **Root Cause Analysis** mindset:
1.  **Isolate:** I separated the specific fault domain.
2.  **Trace:** Implemented logging to track the signal path.
3.  **Resolve:** Applied a fix at the source, not just a patch.

## Installation & Setup

Since I am accustomed to Linux CLI environments, here is the standard setup to get this running on your local machine:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tarakreasi/[repo-name].git

# 2. Navigate to directory
cd [repo-name]

# 3. Install Dependencies (Standard SOP)
composer install --optimize-autoloader
npm ci

# 4. Environment Setup
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# 5. Database Hydration
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate --seed

# 6. Ignition
./local-serve.sh
```

## Retrospective: What I Learned

> "Software is just hardware that you can change instantly. But the discipline to maintain it should remain the same."

*   **Simplify First:** Deleting unnecessary code is harder than writing new code.
*   **Production Mindset:** Running on localhost is easy. Preparing for deployment requires understanding permissions and environment variables.
*   **User-Centricity:** A feature is only "done" when the user can use it without reading a manual—a lesson from my Customer Service days.
