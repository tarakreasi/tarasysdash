# Sprint 3.1: Documentation Architecture

**Objective**: Create clear documentation separating toolkit core from external tools.
**Status**: PLANNING

## Backlog
- [ ] Create `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` explaining toolkit vs external components
- [ ] Update `PM.md` to remove Aider/LLM references (now deterministic-only)
- [ ] Archive `IMPROVEMENT_PROPOSAL.md` to `docs/dev/proposals/`

## Rationale
Before we can deploy this toolkit to other projects, we need crystal-clear docs explaining:
- What is "ours" (the supervisor)
- What is external (Agent OS, Design OS)
- How they relate (optional vs required)
